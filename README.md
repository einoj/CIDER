Custom Image Data ExtractoR

Usage:
  python cider.py #databoxes
  
The image extractor now displays the first of the many images you want to extract data from.
It is opended #databoxes times, and each time you choose a different area from the image to 
extract data from. This of course assumes that all the images have equal layout,
that no windows have been moved.
